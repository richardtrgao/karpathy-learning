# Machine Learning 

This Git repo is to primarily go through Karpathy's machine learning videos. While a lot of the information is/was ingested through watching, I wanted to try out some small code examples that will help cement the information a bit more. This may or may not contain very minimal examples, since this is really just for learning purposes.

## Andrej Karpathy's Channel

Just wanted to link his channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) - it has been tremendously helpful, but also difficult. If anyone ever stumbles across this repo, and wants to talk about life/AI/learnings, reach out! Otherwise, this will stay a secret.
