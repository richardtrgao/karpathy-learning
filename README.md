# Machine Learning 

This Git repo is to primarily go through Karpathy's machine learning videos. While a lot of the information is/was ingested through watching, I wanted to try out some small code examples that will help cement the information a bit more. This may or may not contain very minimal examples, since this is really just for learning purposes.

## Andrej Karpathy's Channel

Just wanted to link his channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) - it has been tremendously helpful, but also difficult. If anyone ever stumbles across this repo, and wants to talk about life/AI/learnings, reach out! Otherwise, this will stay a secret.

## Build
Hopefully I'll have some code in here. For running the code and versions, I'll have more specifics in each sub directory. In general, I'll be testing out [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) for workspace settings. I would highly recommend some sort of environment manager so versions/packages don't get convoluted.
